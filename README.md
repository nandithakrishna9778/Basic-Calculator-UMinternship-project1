# Basic Calculator 
A working calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - handles simple math tasks while following correct operation sequence (like BODMAS or BIDMAS rules). 
#  Project Overview 
This calculator project demonstrates front-end development skills including: 

Clean layout that works well on any device 

- Interactive features using JS to handle math tasks 

- Making sure weird situations don’t break things 

- You can use a keyboard to type stuff 

- Fancy stuff such as working out square roots 
#  Features 

Core Features 

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (/) 

- BODMAS/BIDMAS Support: Follows correct order of operations 

- Decimal Support: Perform calculations with decimal numbers 

- Clear Function: Reset calculator to start fresh 

- Live View: Displays the expression along with what you're typing or the answer so far 

Error Handling 

- Spotting division by zero, then showing an alert 

- Dealing with wrong expressions 

- Stop negative numbers from getting square roots 

- Mathematical error detection (infinity, NaN) 

Extra Features 

- Square Root (√): Calculate square root of numbers 

- Keyboard Support: Use your keyboard for faster input 

- Result Reuse: Continue calculations using previous results 

- Responsive Design: Works on different screen sizes

#  How to Use 

Using Mouse/Touch 

1. Tap digits from 0 to 9 using the number keys 
2. Tap a math symbol - like + or − - to do sums 
3. Tap the dot symbol (.) if you need decimals 
4. Tap = to see the answer 
5. Tap 'Clear' if you want to start over 
6. Tap √ to find the square root of the shown value 

Using Keyboard 

- Numbers: Press 0-9 
- Operators: Hit +, then try -, use instead of times, slash with / 
- Tap the dot button when you need a decimal point. 
- Calculate: Press Enter or = 
- Clear: Press Escape or C 
- Backspace: Delete last character 
#  Installation & Setup 

1. Grab every file. Put them in one folder together 
- index.html 
- style.css 
- script.js
2. Open the calculator: 
- Just hit double-click on index.html so it opens in your go-to browser 
- Alternatively, hit right-click then pick "Open with" to go for a particular browser 
3. No need for a server – this app works right inside your browser 
# Testing Guide 
Basic Operations 
- Check: 5 along with 3 makes 8 
- Check: 10 minus 4 makes 6 
- Check: 6 times 7 makes 42  
- Check: 20 divided by 4 equals 5  

Order of Operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) 
- Check: 2 plus 3 times 4 gives 14  (not twenty) 
- Check: 10 minus 2 times 3 gives 4  (not 24) 
- Check: 8 divided by 2 then add 3 makes 7 
 
Decimal Calculations 
- Check: 5.5 together with 2.3 makes 7.8  
- Check: 10.5 split by 2 gives 5.25 
 
Error Handling 
- Check: 5 ÷ 0 → "Division by zero isn't possible"  
- Test: √(-4) = "Cannot calculate square root of negative number"  

Advanced Features 
- Check: √16 equals 4 
- Check: √25 = 5 

Keyboard Input 
- Check every shortcut shown up there  
#  Design Features 
- Modern UI: Clean, dark-themed interface with gradient background 
- Color-Coded Buttons: 
- Gray: Numbers 
- Orange: Operators 
- Red: Clear 
- Green: Equals 
- Purple: Special functions 
- Hover Effects: Buttons rise slightly when you mouse over them - gives a clearer response 
- Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes
#  Technologies Used 

- HTML5: Structure and semantic markup 
CSS3 handles styling plus brings life to elements with smooth animations - also adapts layout for different screen sizes using flexible setups 
- JavaScript (ES6): handles logic, runs calculations, also adds interactive features 
#  Code Quality 
The code sticks to solid habits
- Use words that show what the value or task does 
- Clear notes that show how things work 
- Handle errors correctly when things get weird 
- Neat code layout but also keeps things sorted properly 
- Doesn't need anything extra to work 
# Known Limitations 
- Big numbers might spill past the screen 
- Tough formulas with brackets don't work yet - might come later 
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) not included in this version 
#  Future Enhancements 
Maybe include these extras: 
( ) help when math gets tricky - use them to group parts so it’s clearer what goes together 
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) 
- Percentage calculations 
- Past math operations 
- Pick your vibe - light or dark 
- Math tool with advanced functions
